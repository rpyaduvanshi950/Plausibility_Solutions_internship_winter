## Projects  

### 1. **Deception Detection in Online AI Interviews**  
A frontend application to identify deception during online AI interviews by analyzing face landmark movements, gaze direction, and blink detection.  
- **Tools and Technologies**: Mediapipe.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  
- **Features**:  
  - Detection of face landmark movements.  
  - Gaze direction tracking.  
  - Blink detection.  
  - Real-person vs. image detection for ensuring authenticity.  
- **Demo**: [View the live demo on CodePen](https://codepen.io/Rao-Pushpender-Yaduvanshi/pen/zxOPLBv).

### 2. **Skill Gap Analysis Framework**  
A research-based project aimed at identifying gaps in skill sets by comparing the job description (JD) requirements with the skills listed on a candidate’s CV.  
- **Tools and Technologies**: ChatGPT API.  
- **Proposed Framework**:  
  - Analyze the job description to extract required skills.  
  - Evaluate the candidate’s CV to determine existing skills.  
  - Highlight the gaps and suggest a personalized roadmap to bridge them.  
  - Generate actionable skill-building plans tailored to the candidate’s current abilities.
